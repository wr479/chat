Hello, this is my project, if you want to run it at home, then do the following:
=======
Install dependencies in the "socket-server" folder:
"npm install cors express nodemon socket.io "

We also install dependencies in the "socket-client" folder:
"npx create-react-app ./"
"npm install emoji-picker-react react-router-dom socket.io-client"

Then just run "npm start"
